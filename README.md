# Python rocket_simulation

Simulating the flight of a water bottle rocket, made for a physics workshop that I taught at a school camp. To run the program, manimlib for python must be installed. The animations produced are therefore also presented in the videos folder.

Made in collaboration with Urban Razpotnik and Simon Bukov≈°ek.

Unresolved issue: videos cannot be made to run in real-time as the drawing function seems to have a limit for speed.
